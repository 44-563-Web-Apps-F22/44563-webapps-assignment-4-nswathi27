    <pre>
            [Enter DAME CARRUTHERS and KATE

        DAME        Warders are ye?
                    Whom do ye ward?
                        Warders are ye?
                      Whom do ye ward?
                 Bolt, bar, and key,
                      Shackle and cord,
                 Fetter and chain,
                      Dungeon and stone,
                 All are in vain—
                      Prisoner's flown!
                Spite of ye all, he is free— he is free!
                Whom do ye ward? Pretty warders are ye!

            [Enter JACK POINT, in low spirits, reading from a huge
            volume
     
       POINT     [reads] "The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No.
                 7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
                 poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
                 councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
                 'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
                 that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
                 away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
                 hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
                 was easier to please than my new master the
                 Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
                 councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
                 heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
                 Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!
     
            [Enter WILFRED, also in low spirits.
     
       WILFRED   [sighing] Ah, Master Point!

            [Enter FAIRFAX

        FAIRFAX   Two days gone, and no news of poor Fairfax. The dolts!
            They seek him everywhere save within a dozen yards of
            his dungeon. So I am free! Free, but for the cursed
            haste with which I hurried headlong into the bonds of
            matrimony with— Heaven knows whom! As far as I
            remember, she should have been young; but even had not
            her face been concealed by her kerchief, I doubt
            whether, in my then plight, I should have taken much
            note of her. Free? Bah! The Tower bonds were but a
            thread of silk compared with these conjugal fetters
            which I, fool that I was, placed upon mine own hands.
            From the one I broke readily enough— how to break the
            other!
                 No. 16. Free from his fetters grim
                              (BALLAD)
                              Fairfax

            [Enter SERGEANT MERYLL

        FAIRFAX   Well, Sergeant Meryll, and how fares thy pretty
                                        charge,Elsie Maynard?
                            
        MERYLL    Well enough, sir. She is quite strong again, and
                                        leaves us to-night.

            [Enter ELSIE

        FAIRFAX   Mistress Elsie!
                                      
        ELSIE     Master Leonard!
                                      
        FAIRFAX   So thou leavest us to-night?
                                      
        ELSIE     Yes. Master Leonard. I have been kindly tended, and I
                        almost fear I am loth to go.
    
            [Enter CHORUS excitedly

            CHORUS      Now what can that have been—
                        A shot so late at night,
                        Enough to cause a fright!
                        What can the portent mean?
                      
                        Are foemen in the land?
                        Is London to be wrecked?
                        What are we to expect?
                        What danger is at hand?
                        Let us understand
                        What danger is at hand!

            [Enter FAIRFAX and TWO YEOMEN from Tower in great
                        excitement.
                 
            FAIRFAX     My lord! I know not how to tell
                            The news I bear!
                        I and my comrades sought the pris'ner's cell—
                            He is not there!
                 
            ALL         He is not there!
                            They sought the pris'ner's cell—
                        he is not there!
