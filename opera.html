    <h6>DAME</h6>

    Warders are ye?
    Whom do ye ward?
    Warders are ye?
    Whom do ye ward?
    Bolt, bar, and key,
    Shackle and cord,

    All are in vain—
    Prisoner's flown!
    Spite of ye all, he is free— he is free!
    Whom do ye ward? Pretty warders are ye!


    [Enter JACK POINT, in low spirits, reading from a huge
    volume

    <h6>POINT</h6>
    <p>[reads] </p>"The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No.
    7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
    poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
    councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
    'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
    that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
    away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
    hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
    was easier to please than my new master the
    Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
    councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
    heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
    Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!

    [Enter WILFRED, also in low spirits

    <h6>WILFRED</h6>
    <p>[sighing]</p> Ah, Master Point! <br><br>

    [Enter FAIRFAX

    <h6>FAIRFAX</h6> Two days gone, and no news of poor Fairfax. The dolts!
    They seek him everywhere save within a dozen yards of
    his dungeon. So I am free! Free, but for the cursed
    haste with which I hurried headlong into the bonds of
    matrimony with— Heaven knows whom! As far as I
    remember, she should have been young; but even had not
    her face been concealed by her kerchief, I doubt
    whether, in my then plight, I should have taken much
    note of her. Free? Bah! The Tower bonds were but a
    thread of silk compared with these conjugal fetters
    which I, fool that I was, placed upon mine own hands.
    From the one I broke readily enough— how to break the
    other!
    No. 16. Free from his fetters grim

    almost fear I am loth to go.

    [Enter CHORUS excitedly

    <p>
    CHORUS Now what can that have been—
    A shot so late at night,
    Enough to cause a fright!
    What can the portent mean?

    Are foemen in the land?
    Is London to be wrecked?
    What are we to expect?
    What danger is at hand?
    Let us understand
    What danger is at hand!

    [Enter FAIRFAX and TWO YEOMEN from Tower in great
    excitement.

    <h6>FAIRFAX</h6> My lord! I know not how to tell
    The news I bear!

    <h6>POINT</h6> Oh! a private buffoon is a light-hearted loon,
    If you listen to popular rumour;
    From morning to night he's so joyous and bright,
    And he bubbles with wit and good humour!
    He's so quaint and so terse,
    Both in prose and in verse;
    Yet though people forgive his transgression,
    There are one or two rules that all family fools
    Must observe, if they love their profession.
    There are one or two rules,
    Half-a-dozen, maybe,
    That all family fools,
    Of whatever degree,
    Must observe if they love their profession.

    That placed me in thy pow'r
    Would I had died!

    I am thy bride!
