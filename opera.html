    Bolt, bar, and key,

    <p class="direction">[reads] </p>"The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No.
    7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
    poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
    councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
    'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
    that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
    away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
    hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
    was easier to please than my new master the
    Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
    councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
    heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
    Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!

    [Enter FAIRFAX

    <h6 class="FAIRFAX name">FAIRFAX</h6> Two days gone, and no news of poor Fairfax. The dolts!
    They seek him everywhere save within a dozen yards of
    his dungeon. So I am free! Free, but for the cursed
    haste with which I hurried headlong into the bonds of
    matrimony with— Heaven knows whom! As far as I
    remember, she should have been young; but even had not
    her face been concealed by her kerchief, I doubt
    whether, in my then plight, I should have taken much
    note of her. Free? Bah! The Tower bonds were but a
    thread of silk compared with these conjugal fetters
    which I, fool that I was, placed upon mine own hands.
    From the one I broke readily enough— how to break the
    other!
    No. 16. Free from his fetters grim

     Now what can that have been—
    A shot so late at night,
